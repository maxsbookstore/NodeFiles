# NodeFiles

Step 1
In step1.js, write a function, cat.

It should take one argument, path, and it should read the file with that path, and print the contents of that file.

Step 2
Copy over your step1.js code to step2.js

Add a new function, webCat. This should take a URL and, using axios, should read the content of that URL and print it to the console.

Modify the code that invoked cat so that, based on the command-line args, it decides whether the argument is a file path or a URL and calls either cat or webCat, respectively.

Step 3
Copy over your step2.js code to step3.js.

Add a feature where, on the command line, you can optionally provide an argument to output to a file instead of printing to the console. The argument should look like this: --out output-filename.txt readfile-or-url.
